# Post-processing Stack v2

This branch is under active development and holds the upcoming version of the post-processing stack. Although it is fairly stable at this point it is still considered to be in a **beta** state.

If you're looking for the previous version of the post-processing stack, checkout the [v1 branch](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/tree/v1) instead.
